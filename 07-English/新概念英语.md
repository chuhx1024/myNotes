## A private conversetion
```
Last week I went to the theatre
I have a very good seat
The play was very interestion
I did not enjoy it
A young man and a youny weman were sitting behind me
they were takding loudly
I got very angry
I could not hear the actors
I truned round
I looked at the man and the woman angrily
They did not pay ang attention
In the end 
I could not bear it
I turned round again
I can't hear a word I saied angrily
It's none of your business the youny man sid rudely
This is a private conversation
