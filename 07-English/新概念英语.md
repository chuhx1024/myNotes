The play was very interestion
I did not enjoy it
A young man and a youny weman were sitting behind me
they were takding loudly
I got very angry
I could not hear the actors
I truned round
I looked at the man and the woman angrily
They did not pay ang attention
In the end 
I could not bear it
I turned round again
I can't hear a word I saied angrily

This is a private conversation

The plane was late and detectives were waiting at the airport all morning.
They were expecting a valuable parcel of diamonds from South Africe.
A few hours earlier,
someone had told the police that thieves would try to steal the diamonds.
When the plane arrived, some of the detectives were waiting inside the main building while
other were waiting on the airfield.
Two men took the parcel off the plane and carried it into the Customs House.
While two detectives were keeping guard at the door, two others opened the parcel.
To their surprise, the precious parcel was full of stones and sand.

## The best and the worst
```
Joe Sanders has the most beautiful garden in our town.
Nearly everbody enters for The Nicest Garden Competition each year,
but Joe wins every time, Bill Frith's garden is larger than Joe's.
Bill works harder than Joe and grows more flowers and vegetables,
but Joe's garden is more interesing. He has made neat paths and has built a 
wooden bridge over a pool. I like gardens too, but I do not like hard work.
Every year I enter for the garden competition too, and I always win a little 
prize for the worst garden in the town.

## 9. A cold welcome
```
On Wednesday evening, we went to the Town Hall. It was the last day of the year
and a large crowd of people had gathered under the Town Hall clock. It would strike
twelve minutes' time. Fifteen minutes passed and then, at five to twelve, the clock 
stopped. The big minute hand did not move. We waited and waited, but nothing happened.
Suddenly someone shouted. It's two minutes past twelve! The clock has stopped. I looked at
my watch. It was true. The big clock refused to welcome the New Year. At that moment, everybody
began to laugh and sing.
