## A private conversetion
```
Last week I went to the theatre
I have a very good seat
The play was very interestion
I did not enjoy it
A young man and a youny weman were sitting behind me
they were takding loudly
I got very angry
I could not hear the actors
I truned round
I looked at the man and the woman angrily
They did not pay ang attention
In the end 
I could not bear it
I turned round again
I can't hear a word I saied angrily
It's none of your business the youny man sid rudely
This is a private conversation

```

## Breakfast or lunch
```
It was Sunday
I never get up early on Sundays
I sometimes stay in bed until lunchtime 
Last Sunday I got up very late 
I looked out of the window
I was dark outside
What a day
I thought It's raining again
Just then  the telephone rang 
It was my aunt Lucy
I've just arrived by train
she said I'm coming to see you
But I'm still having breakfast I said
what are you doing she asked
I'm having breakfast I repeated
Dear me she said Do you always get up so late It's one o'clock
